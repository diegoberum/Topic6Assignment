From this assignment, we gained a greater understanding of lambda calculus. By using pure lambda and Haskell, we were able to define and execute a function entirely through lambda expressions, showcasing how computation can be achieved without built-in numbers, control structures, or operators. This assignment showed Haskell’s strengths with lambda calculus, reinforcing our understanding of its foundation. Overall, we gained valuable insights into functional programming’s capabilities and lambda calculus in constructing logical expressions and functions.
